### Features
Multiple Algorithms: The visualizer supports a variety of pathfinding algorithms, including A* (A Star), Dijkstra's algorithm, Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, and more. Users can choose the algorithm that best suits their needs.

Maze Generation: Users can generate custom mazes with walls or weighted nodes, or even a combination of both. This feature allows for simulating real-world scenarios where paths may be obstructed or have varying degrees of cost.

Interactive Grid: Easily add walls, weighted nodes, and checkpoints to the grid. The visualizer provides an intuitive interface to modify the terrain and customize the pathfinding environment.

Depth-Based Visualization: As the algorithm explores the grid, the visualization dynamically changes colors to indicate the depth of exploration. This feature helps users track the progress of the algorithm in real-time.

Statistics Tracking: The visualizer keeps track of essential statistics such as the number of steps taken and the length of the path found. This information helps users evaluate the efficiency of different algorithms.

Customization: Users can customize the grid size and the appearance of nodes, including checkpoints, start and end nodes, and walls. Tailor the visualizer to match your specific requirements and preferences.

Control and Speed: The tool offers control options such as pause, start, continue, or step-by-step execution. Additionally, a speed slider allows users to adjust the visualization speed to match their preferred pace.
